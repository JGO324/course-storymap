# Course-storymap

### Welcome to my final project of map672.

This time I was looking for something different for my final project of map672.

I thought on why not a story map like 
 [Esri StoryMaps](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-storymaps/stories).
 
 I know that this will be a tough work. I can't create a storyMap exactly like esri storyMaps with leaflet, it is to much work, so, I thought of using the parallax scrolling layout to create simple story map.

see. [Parallax](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_parallax.asp) for simplicity.

I choose 3 maps of my previous course of map672. these are:

-	A vacation to Azores
-	A vacation to Madeira
-	And a route map of my daily route to work.


To create the story map, I need to create 3 js script file for each map for 3 different div map area.

```
<div id="map1"></div>
<div id="map2"></div>
<div id="map3"></div>

```


This is all I need to do to create this story map and some css to manipulate the layout of the parallax.

I want to Thanks Boyd for this courses so I can improve my skills.
